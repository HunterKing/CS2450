# Homework Programming Assignments
These are assignments considered larger scale than regular homework, that are often due at the end of the week rather than by the next class.

### Program 1: LC3 - Multiply and Integer Input
Take a value with a GETNUM subroutine, which ignores non-numeric values. Add a MULT subroutine which multiplies two values optimally, as well as GETDEC, which can print a decimal value.

### Program 2: Arrays in C
Use arrays in C to get the average, max, min, mode, and count of the mode values.

### Program 3: Structures in C
Use a structure "person", and take input from user of Full Name, SSN, year of birth. After taking values, print each of them inline seperated by colons.

### Program 4: Bit Manipulation
Write a function to create a mask given a starting and ending bit. Use the mask to extract a "sub-int" from a given integer. Write a function to print out a number in hexidecimal with a dash between each digit.
