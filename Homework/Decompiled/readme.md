# Decompiled Homework Assignments
These homework assignments were assigned such that we would write all of our instructions in hex and run them in an LC-3 simulator before we were allowed to use the Assembler. This is hard to read, however, so these are their contents disassembled using [Program 6 - LC-3 Disassembler](Assignments/Program 6 - LC-3 Disassembler).
